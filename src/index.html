<!-- UTF-8

UTF-8 stands for "Unicode Transformation Format â€“ 8-bit".

Itâ€™s a character encoding used to represent text in computers.

UTF-8 can represent every character in the Unicode standard (like English, Hindi, Chinese, emojis, etc.).

How it works:

It uses 1 to 4 bytes per character:

1 byte (8 bits) for basic English letters (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z, numbers, symbols).

2â€“4 bytes for other languages and special characters (à¤¹, ä¸­, ðŸ˜Š).

Why itâ€™s popular:

Backward compatible with ASCII (English characters are stored the same way).

Efficient: Saves space for texts mostly in English.

Universal: Supports all world languages and symbols.

Web standard: Most websites and APIs use UTF-8 by default.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

Letter A â†’ stored as 01000001 (1 byte) in UTF-8.

Character à¤¹ â†’ stored as 3 bytes in UTF-8.

Emoji ðŸ˜Š â†’ stored as 4 bytes in UTF-8.

Would you like me to also explain difference between UTF-8, UTF-16, and ASCII so you can compare easily? -->


 <!-- //(Unicode Transformation Format). -->
<!-- UTF-8	A variable-length character encoding (1 to 4 bytes long). UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII and the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages.
UTF-16	A variable-length character encoding. UTF-16 is used in all major operating systems like Windows, IOS, and Unix. -->
